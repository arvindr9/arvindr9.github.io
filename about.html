			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>Hello! My name is Arvind, and I am
  a rising freshman at Georgia Tech. I am currently majoring in computer science. See my resume <a href = "resume/Resume.pdf" target = "blank">here</a>.
</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>I have a passion in artificial intelligence and am
currently doing AI research. Aside from that, I have an interest in
mathematics (especially in the field of combinatorics) and especially
enjoy participating in math contests like ARML. And of course, the limitless nature of
HTML and CSS fascinates me.</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: I completed the Machine Learning
                course by the Stanford professor Andrew Ng. I now have knowledge
                of supervised learning algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms.
                I also took his deep learning specialization in Python, which gave me skills of training deep neural networks and solving problems in image processing.
	    
	    	<p> I am currently doing research in the Interactive Optimization and Learning Lab under the supervision
			of Professor Sebastian Pokutta. I am currently focusing on fooling random forests classifiers with adversarial
			examples (more specifically in this case image samples that are perturbed by random but imperceptible noise)
			to refute former beliefs that random forests are robust to adversarial examples. I am also proposing
			a method to make random forests more robust to these adversarial examples. 
			<a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/isye-7687-spring-2018/index">This website</a> has many nice links to papers about adversarial examples and other areas of machine learning
			(like Online Learning and Reinforcement Learning)
	    </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Competitive programming</strong>:
      <p>I have competed in contests like ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) and enjoy solving ad-hoc problems that I haven't seen before.</p>
	    
      <p>I generally use C++ for programming contests since its standard library has useful builtin data structures
	    (pairs, sets, maps, queues, dequeues, etc...). I sometimes use Python for simpler problems that just
	    require a few lines of code.</p>
      <p>I am currently practicing competitive programming under the former ICPC World Finalist Mostafa Saad.
	    I feel that I am learning and improving a lot, and I hope to be among the top ten in the nation in my sophomore year.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mathematics</strong>: I have participated in math competitions like ARML
      (American Regions Mathematics League) in high school, and as a president of my
      school's math team, I have been very involved in math. I am particularly interested
      by fields of discrete mathematics like combinatorics and number theory.
	    <br>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mobile App Development</strong>: I helped create the <emph>Science Bowl</emph> app for <a href = 'http://outplayedapps.com/' target = '_blank'><emph>Outplayed Apps</emph></a>.
      The app was built with the Ionic framework, which used HTML, CSS, JS and AngularJS. 
	<p>I am currently in the process of creating a React Native app for the nonprofit
	    Hindu organization Chinmaya Mission, which will allow Acharyas (holy members of Chinmaya Mission)
	    to communicate with each other and post news events.</p>
	  </li>
    
    <li><strong>Violin</strong>: I have played the violin since 4th grade (in 2008) and started private lessons in 8th grade (2012).
      I played in the Georgia All-State Orchestra in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and was a member of the nationally recognized
      Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra in the 2016-2017 season.
    </li>
