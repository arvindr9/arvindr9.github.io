			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>Hello! My name is Arvind, and I am
  a rising freshman at Georgia Tech. I plan to major in
  mathematics and computer science.
</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>I have a passion in artificial intelligence and am
currently working on a neural network. Aside from that, I have an interest in
mathematics (especially in the field of combinatorics) and especially
enjoy participating in math contests like ARML. And of course, the limitless nature of
HTML and CSS fascinates me.</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: I completed the Machine Learning
                course by the Stanford professor Andrew Ng. I now have knowledge
                of supervised learning algorithms (regression, neural networks, SVMs)
                and unsupervised learning algorithms (K-means clustering, Principal Component
                Analysis).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mathematics</strong>: I have participated in math competitions like ARML
      (American Regions Mathematics League) in high school, and as a president of my
      school's math team, I have been very involved in math. I am particularly interested
      by fields of discrete mathematics like combinatorics and number theory.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Web development</strong>: I have familiarity with HTML and CSS, as can evidently be seen by looking at my website!
      I also have experience with Javascript and AngularJS. Right now, I am self-studying Stanford University's <a href = 'https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193x/' target = '_blank'>CS193X course</a>, which is very high-quality!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mobile App Development</strong>: I helped create the <emph>Science Bowl</emph> app for <a href = 'http://outplayedapps.com/' target = '_blank'><emph>Outplayed Apps</emph></a>.
      The app was built with the Ionic framework, which used HTML, CSS, JS and AngularJS.
    </li>
    <li><strong>General programming</strong>: I have experience in Java, having taken AP Computer Science.
      I also have incorporated GUIs into Java projects and am now learning
      data structures like linked-lists and trees (a result of my avid usage of HackerRank).
      I also have experience in the Python programming language.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Violin</strong>: I have played the violin since 4th grade (in 2008) and started private lessons in 8th grade (2012).
      I played in the Georgia All-State Orchestra in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and was a member of the nationally recognized
      Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra in the 2016-2017 season.
    </li>
  </ul>
