			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>Hello! My name is Arvind, and I am
  a rising freshman at Georgia Tech. I am currently majoring in computer science. See my resume <a href = "resume/Resume_2017.pdf" target = "blank">here</a>.
</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>I have a passion in artificial intelligence and am
currently working on a neural network. Aside from that, I have an interest in
mathematics (especially in the field of combinatorics) and especially
enjoy participating in math contests like ARML. And of course, the limitless nature of
HTML and CSS fascinates me.</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: I completed the Machine Learning
                course by the Stanford professor Andrew Ng. I now have knowledge
                of supervised learning algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms.
                I also took his deep learning specialization in Python, which gave me skills of training deep neural networks and solving problems in image processing.
	    	<p>Also, at HackGT, I helped create a program to detect fraud in credit cards using anomaly detection based on features
                like the time of transaction, the cost of the transaction and the geographic distance
                compared to the previous ten transactions. See <a href = "https://devpost.com/software/fiscalert" target = '_blank'>here</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Competitive programming</strong>: I am mainly experienced in Java but am looking to understand the deeper rules of OOP.
      Also, I am familiar with data structures like stacks, queues, linked-lists, tries, binary search trees, and hash tables.
      I am looking to practice implementing these data structures in programming contests, in addition to algorithmic techniques like breadth-first and depth-first
      search and topological sort. 

      <p>I have competed in contests like ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) and enjoy solving ad-hoc problems that I haven't seen before.</p>
	    
      <p>I also have experience with Python and have a basic familiarity with C++. I'm planning on learning more C++ since it is said to have many libraries that are
	      useful in programming contests.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mathematics</strong>: I have participated in math competitions like ARML
      (American Regions Mathematics League) in high school, and as a president of my
      school's math team, I have been very involved in math. I am particularly interested
      by fields of discrete mathematics like combinatorics and number theory.
	    <br>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Web development</strong>: I have familiarity with HTML and CSS, as can evidently be seen by looking at my website!
      I also have experience with JS, Angular, Node, React and MongoDB. 
      I am in a club called Bits of Good, where people design websites for nonprofits such as World Water Relief. The club also invoves side projects using the MERN stack
      (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).
      Also check out Stanford University's <a href = 'https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193x/' target = '_blank'>CS193X course</a>, which is of a very high quality!
    <br>
	  </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mobile App Development</strong>: I helped create the <emph>Science Bowl</emph> app for <a href = 'http://outplayedapps.com/' target = '_blank'><emph>Outplayed Apps</emph></a>.
      The app was built with the Ionic framework, which used HTML, CSS, JS and AngularJS.
    <br>
	  </li>
    
    <li><strong>Violin</strong>: I have played the violin since 4th grade (in 2008) and started private lessons in 8th grade (2012).
      I played in the Georgia All-State Orchestra in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and was a member of the nationally recognized
      Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra in the 2016-2017 season.
