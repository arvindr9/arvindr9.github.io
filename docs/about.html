I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. My interests lie in graphs, combinatorial optimization, and machine learning theory.

<h2>Other interests</h2>

<p>I used to be involved in math contests in high school (AIME / ARML), and am now involved in competitive programming.
Here is my <a href = "https://codeforces.com/profile/arvindr9">Codeforces profile</a>.

<p>I like to play the violin. I was in the Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra in my senior year of high school (2016 - 2017),
    and I now play the violin as a member of the Georgia Tech Orchestras.
