Hello! I am Arvind, a student at Georgia Tech. I have decided to start a blog.

## What is this the purpose of this blog?

I've been studying research areas in theoretical computer science (related to graphs, combinatorial optimization, and machine learning). I'd like this blog to be a resource for others to learn tidbits about research that has been done in these topics, and I plan to write about recent things that I have learned / worked on.
